Q1
h3 as a bad mask, being /31 and not /24 as everybody else.

Q2
When we set the IP for h3. So `h3 = net.addHost('h3', ip='10.0.0.3/31')`.

Q3
```
ip addr flush dev h3-eth0
ip addr add 10.0.1.3/24 dev h3-eth0
```

Q4
To launch on h1: `ping 10.0.0.2`.

Q5
Not any.

Q6
The hub is a device to act as if the connected hosts are on the same cable, so
the paquets are simply forwarded transparently, thus there is not change.
