Q1
h4 is not on the correct network. Found out by trying to ping h4 from h1.

Q2
When we set the IP for h4. So `ip addr add 10.0.1.4/24 dev PC4-eth0`.

Q3
`ip addr add 10.0.0.4/24 dev PC4-eth0`.

Q4
To launch on h1: `ping 10.0.0.2`.

Q5
Not any.

Q6
The hub is a device to act as if the connected hosts are on the same cable, so
the paquets are simply forwarded transparently, thus there is not change.
