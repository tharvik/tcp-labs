1
a	Client because it doesn't bind to a port
b	UDP, because of socket.SOCK_DGRAM

2
a	"Message sent"
b	"Received data:  Hello, Romeo" and "From Address:  ('127.0.0.1', 38569)"

3
TCP because of socket.SOCK_STREAM, IPv4 because of socket.AF_INET (for IPv6, we
would use SOCKET.AF_INET6 instead)

4
It shows the current state of the socket on the system, the columns shows some
data on each. In order, there is: protocol, data received but not read yet, data
send but not yet ack by the other side, the address it is bind to, the address
it is connected to (in this case, none, because he is waiting for a client),
the state in which he is (LISTEN in this case because he is waiting on a client
to connect)

5
There is first the server socket waiting for new connections, then, there is the
server socket of the new connection made by the client, finally, there is the
client socket connected to the server

6
3 lines, you can change the number of line by changing the connection.recv() by
another value than 16

7
No, because the socket isn't closed on the client side thus the
connection.recv() still wait for some data

8
No, the listening socket is only used to generate new connections and for each
new one, it will create a new socket 

9
20 messages, with either d=0 and d=1
