1
Loss probability is 0%
Goodput is 100 kbit/s

2
1 Mbps:		loss of 0%, goodput of 1 Mbps
10 Mbps:	loss of 0%, goodput of 10 Mbps
100 Mbps:	loss of 4.1%, goodput of 9600 kbps
1 Gbps:		loss of 90.4%, goodput of 9600 kbps
The loss is greater than 1% with 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps. It is because of the too
high load on the network and the fact that we limited the bandwith of the link
between r1 and sw2 (by reducing the bandwith of one of the interface).

3
9294 kbps

4
The ethernet header is 144 bits
The IP header is 128 bits
The UDP header is 64 bits
So the overhead is 144 + 128 + 64 = 336 bits
When the rate < 50 kbps: 336 + 125 * 8 = 1336 bits
When the rate > 50 kbps: 336 + 1000 * 8 = 8336 bits
With wireshark, we indeed have these total values

5
The size of application data divided by the total size multiplied by the
bandwith
8000 / 8336 * 3 = 2.879 Mbps

6
No loss and goodput of 100 kbps

7
3 Mbps:		loss of 0%, goodput of 2880 kbits
10 Mbps:	loss of 70.9%, goodput of 2880 kbits
This is coherent with the computed goodput

8
The ethernet header is 144 bits
The IP header is 128 bits
The TCP header is 160 bits
So the overhead is 144 + 128 + 160 = 432 bits
Thus the total size is 432 + 1000 * 8 = 8432 bits
	??? data field is of size 2896 bytes -> frame size is 23696 bits
	??? option field exists with 12 bytes

9 ??? same as 5

10 ??? same a 6
