1 Mbps:		loss of 0%, goodput of 1 Mbps
10 Mbps:	loss of 0%, goodput of 10 Mbps
100 Mbps:	loss of 4.1%, goodput of 9600 kbps
1 Gbps:		loss of 90.4%, goodput of 9600 kbps
The loss is greater than 1% with 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps. It is because of the too
high load on the network and the fact that we limited the bandwith of the link
between r1 and sw2 (by reducing the bandwith of one of the interface).
